Note: If you are hacking from a Windows 10 Machine, I HIGHLY recommend working with the Ubuntu Subsystem for Windows 10.
Otherwise, I recommend a VM with a Linux distribution. I've written the bootstrap instructions considering a *nix style machine, but I can try to help if you need it to work on Windows.

To get started, please install:

JDK: sudo apt install default-jdk
Maven: sudo apt install maven

Get bootstrapped:
- JDK
- Maven
- Spring
