2. Then download what you need from the following assets [linked here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aDOAbfse2m25eCojcOAHTNubhH4SLnn7)
3. You will also need a Google Translate API key. Keep your eye on the slack channel 'challenge-lingolab' for the key.

Join us on Slack: [Slack H4M](http://hack4missions.slack.com)

## Goals to Reach
1. Appeal visually and follow Wycliffe’s brand style
2. Translate the user’s name when available or transliterate by default
3. Allow users to share and print with an option to join Wycliffe’s e-newsletter list
4. Run on multiple platforms

## Goals to Stretch for
* Word-filter for entries
* Offline version
* Share on Facebook and Twitter as an image and choose a designed background template like in YouVersion
* Store entries for data analysis (e.g. take most popular names and stock personalized items in Wycliffe’s gift shop)
